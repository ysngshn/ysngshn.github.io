Before the more serious part, let me talk about my hobbies :smile:: I am a fan of sci-fi litterature and an audiophile. I like swimming and badminton. And I play ukulele.

## Teaching experience

You can visit my [CVG page](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/members/sheny#teaching) for a list of my teaching activities at TUM. In summary:

- Teaching assistant for lectures: 
  - "Convex Optimization for Machine Learning and Computer Vision" (WS18)
  - "Probabilistic Graphical Models in Computer Vision" (SS19)
- Co-organize practical courses and seminars:
  - "Learning For Self-Driving Cars and Intelligent Systems" (practical course, WS19)
  - "Beyond Deep Learning: Uncertainty Aware Models" (practical course, SS20)
  - "Beyond Deep Learning: Selected Topics on Novel Challenges" (seminar WS20-SS22)

Additionally, I have also supervised several individual student projects including master thesis, interdisciplinary project and guided research, some of which results in publications.
